Normally you would assign these attachments in your animation program (Spine), but with this function you can create/replace your own at run-time using a sprite asset from your game. the function requires that you give the attachment a name (as a string) and then set the sprite_index and image_index to use, as well as the x and y origin (which can be different to that defined by the sprite in the sprite properties), and you can also set any transforms that you wish to be applied to the image when attached, as well as the colour to be blended with the image and it's alpha (transparency) value.
